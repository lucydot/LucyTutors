## Who am I?

Hello! I'm Lucy, your friendly neighbourhood maths tutor :)

* I am a qualified mathematics teacher, and I have taught maths in a variety of contexts - primary schools, colleges, universities and in the community.
* I have a Masters degree in mathematical physics - i.e. I *love* maths.
* I am a university researcher in computational materials science - if you would like to know more about my research see my [other website](https://lucydot.github.io).

</br>


## Who do I tutor?

I tutor...

* anyone who would like to improve their mathematical confidence, knowledge or skills
* all ages - I have experience teaching ages 5-70 years
* all abilities - from those with very little mathematical experience to undergraduate degree level
* children or adults preparing for specific exams (SATs, GCSEs, A-levels, Basic Skills)
* students looking for a one-off tutorial on a particular topic, or students looking for regular weekly/monthly tutoring

If in doubt, send an email enquiry to [lucy@lucytutors.co.uk](mailto:lucy@lucytutors.co.uk?subject=Tutoring).

## Where do I tutor?

I am based in Balsall Heath, South Birmingham. Tutorials take place at my house in Balsall Heath, or I can travel to addresses in Balsall Heath, Moseley or Kings Heath.

## How do I tutor?

My tutoring philosophy is "build mathematical confidence and the rest will follow". 
You can use the internet to learn step-by-step mathematical recipes, but a good tutor will build confidence and make sure that your conceptual understanding is solid.

* I tutor in a friendly, positive way to build mathematical confidence 
* I use whiteboards, diagrams and objects (counters, blocks) to aid conceptual understanding
* I work with the student to find the misunderstandings that lead to mathematical mishaps

## What do I charge?

My rate is **£30 per hour**. Perhaps you have a friend who is also looking for a tutor? --> I teach small groups at a reduced rate per student:

* 2 students for 1 hour: £44 (£22 per student)
* 3 students for 1 hour: £54 (£18 per student)

For small group teaching to be effective, students should be working at roughly the same ability level.
